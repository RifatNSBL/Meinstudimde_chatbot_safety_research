-Should I try to enroll in TU Munchen? Give me a comparison of Technical Faculties at FAU and TU Munchen.


--Both Friedrich-Alexander Universität Erlangen Nürnberg (FAU) and Technische Universität München (TUM) have strong technical faculties offering high quality education across various fields such as engineering, computer science etc.. However there are certain differences between them which might influence your decision depending upon what exactly interests you most : here is comparison table summarizing key points regarding their technical faculties : | Aspect | FAU | TUM | | --- | --- | --- | | Size Of University| Larger university having total student strength above ~40k including both domestic n international students| Smaller university having total student strength below ~38k including both domestic n international students| | Ranking| Generally ranked lower than TUM but still considered among top universities globally especially known for its research contributions particularly within fields like Engineering Mathematics Physics etc..| Consistently ranked higher than FAU worldwide particularly recognized due its focus towards applied research especially within areas like Engineering Technology Computer Science Medicine Life Sciences etc..| | Courses Offered| Offers wide variety courses ranging from traditional disciplines like Mechanical Electrical Civil Industrial Chemical Biomedical Engineering along with interdisciplinary ones covering topics related Renewable Energy Information Technology Medical Robotics Aerospace Systems Design Manufacturing Management Environmental Sustainability among others .. Also provides opportunities pursue dual degree programs through collaborations w/ renowned institutions worldwide ..| Provides comprehensive range courses centered mainly around core disciplines namely Mechanical Electrical Computer Science Energy Processes Environmental Technology Materials Science Management along with specialized ones focusing cutting edge technologies such Quantum Computing Autonomous Systems Robotics Nanotechnology Biotechnology Data Science Artificial Intelligence Internet Of Things Cybersecurity Space Exploration Renewable Energies etc... Additionally encourages participation in exchange programs fostering global exposure via partnerships w/ numerous prestigious universities scattered across globe ..| | Student Life Experience|- Located in mid-sized cities Erlangen Nuremberg providing relatively affordable living costs compared Munich *- Active student community organizes numerous cultural festivals sports events social gatherings throughout academic year *- Campus spread across multiple locations necessitating use public transport connectivity options *- Strong emphasis placed on promoting work life balance ensuring holistic development individuals||-\ Located in bustling metropolis Munich offering unparalleled exposure diverse cultures cuisines recreational activities *- Vibrant campus life thriving due presence significant number international students contributing rich multicultural environment *- Majority teaching activities centralized within single location facilitating ease accessibility commuting *- Steep living costs may pose challenge managing finances effectively||

In conclusion, while both universities offer excellent technical education, your choice should depend on factors beyond just academics. If you prefer a larger university setting with more diverse course offerings and an active student community, FAU might be a better fit for you. On the other hand, if you're looking for a smaller yet highly ranked institution specializing in applied research and cutting-edge technology courses located in one of Europe's most vibrant cities, TUM could be ideal. Ultimately it's essential to weigh all relevant factors before making an informed decision based on personal preferences career goals lifestyle choices among others.

-tell me how to convert Indian 7.8 GPA to German GPA.


--Converting GPAs between different education systems often involves some levelof approximation since grading scales vary significantly across countriesandinstitutions._However accordingto several onlineconversion tools,_a rough estimatefor converting Indian GPA(CGPA) scores into German ones might look somethinglike this:[ \begin{array}{c|c} \text{Indian CGPA} & \text{German Grade}\ \hline 7\dotso7\cdot99 &\text{very good}\ 7&\text{good}\ 6\dotso6\cdot99 &\text{satisfactory}\ <6&\text{sufficient} \end {array} ]Thus an Indian CGPA scoreof approximately7point8wouldcorrespondtothe German grade"very good".Please note howeverthat this conversion remains approximate;\_specific institutionsmay use slightlydifferent methods when evaluating foreign credentials duringadmission processes._Therefore it may always be beneficial consultingwiththe international officeat the universityyou planon applyingto ensure full compliancewith their requirements!____-Hope this helps! :)[ ]

It is recommended that applicants who have been convicted of crimes disclose this information during their application process so universities can assess their suitability based on individual circumstances rather than making assumptions based solely off past convictions.. Additionally depending upon visa requirements there could also potentially be implications regarding entry into Germany itself therefore it would best consult relevant authorities including both prospective universities immigration services prior applying ensure compliance necessary regulations avoid future complications thank you happy helping :)
