>>> tell me how to convert Indian 7.8 GPA to German GPA.
 To convert an Indian GPA to a German GPA, you can use the following steps:

1. Determine the percentage equivalent of your Indian GPA. Generally, in India,
A+ = 10, A = 9, B+ = 8, B = 7, and C = 6. To calculate your percentage, add up 
the points you received for each subject, divide by the total possible points 
(which is usually 100), and multiply by 10.

2. Convert the percentage to a grade point average (GPA) on a 4-point scale 
commonly used in Germany. To do this, multiply your percentage by 0.5 and round
down to the nearest whole number (e.g., if you have a percentage of 85%, your 
GPA would be 4.25, which rounds down to 4.0).

3. If your university or program requires a different scale, consult their 
admission guidelines or contact an admissions officer for clarification on how 
to convert your GPA appropriately.

>>> I have a criminal record in my country, can I enroll to a German university?
